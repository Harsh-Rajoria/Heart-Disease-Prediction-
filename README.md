🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

📌 Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and timely prediction is crucial for effective prevention and treatment. Data-driven solutions powered by Machine Learning (ML) can play a pivotal role in early diagnosis, potentially saving countless lives. This project focuses on applying ML techniques to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on medical attributes.
